//Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string
//Using the UEBSL approach,then
//1. Understanding the problem would result into:
//   i. Problem in my own words: a function that inputs a string and returns the number of times each
//      character appers in the string
//   ii. Inputs: any string
//   iii. Outputs: an [] or {} denoting how many times each character appears in the string
//   iv. Do I have all Info to solve the problem: Not sure, what happens if the function receives 
//       nothing or numbers
//   v. function name - charCount, input - str, output - result

//2. After Understanding the problem, I would then proceed to Explore Concrete Examples of the problem
//   i. charCount('aaabccccc') // {a:3, b:1, c:5} //I could also ask myself if I should return other
//                                                            special characters that are missing from the input
//   ii. charCount('My phone is my 077550224') // what should we do with the empty spaces? what should we do with
//                                             the numbers
//       charCount('My phone is my own') // What should we do with upper case and lower case characters that are
//                                          the same?
//   iii. charCount() or charCount('')// what happens if we receive empty inputs?
//   iv. charCount(12), charCount({}), charCount([]) // what happens if we receive invalid input?
