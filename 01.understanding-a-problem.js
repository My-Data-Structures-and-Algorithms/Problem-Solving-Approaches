//1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
//3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
//4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
//5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

//Example problem: Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum?
//1. Restating the problem: a function that adds numbers
//2. Are the numbers integers? or floats?, What is the size of the numbers we are adding?, Are we only adding two numbers?
//3. What is the data type of the result? Is it an integer or a string? How should the result look like?
//4. Not really, what happens if the function only receives one input? or an input that is not a number?
//5. function name - add, input names - num1, num2, output name - sum or total or doesn't need a name

let add = (num1, num2) => total = num1 + num2; //or
let add1 = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;

console.log(add(230, 230));
console.log(add(230, 230));
